AWS Amplify is everything frontend developers need to develop and deploy cloud-powered fullstack applications without hassle. Easily connect your frontend to the cloud for data modeling, authentication, storage, serverless functions, SSR app deployment, and more.

## Build fullstack apps with your framework of choice

You can use AWS Amplify with popular web and mobile frameworks like JavaScript, Flutter, Swift, and React. Build, connect, and host fullstack apps on AWS. Get started by selecting your preferred framework.

## Features

### Code-first DX

The fullstack TypeScript developer experience lets you focus on your app code instead of infrastructure.

### Fullstack Git deployments

Deploy your frontend and backend together on every code commit. Your Git branch is the source of truth.

### Faster local development

Per-developer cloud sandbox environments let you quickly iterate during development.
